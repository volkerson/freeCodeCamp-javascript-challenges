# FreeCodeCamp - Roman Numeral Converter (JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures)

# Challenge
Convert the given number (provided in the test-cases) into a roman numeral. All roman numerals answers should be provided in upper-case.

# About 
This is my solution to the challenge. I wrote the challenge in my Unit Test Environment, based on Mocha and Chai.<br>
If you're taking the course 'JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures' on FreeCodeCamp right now and you feel stuck - feel free to download my solution, try to recreate it and/or come up with a better solution.

# Mocha/Chai Test Unit - The files
The <strong>index.html</strong> implements all needed files. You don't need to make any changes in that file.<br><br>
The <strong>tests.js</strong> is the file where you can add, edit and remove the test cases. I added all the tests from FreeCodeCamp. So you don't have to make any changes here. But of course, feel free to play around with that file. If you're new to Chai, take a look at the Chai Documentation.<br><br>
The <strong>problems.js</stong> is the file with my solution to the challenge.
