# FreeCodeCamp - Telephone Number Validator

# Challenge
Return true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.

The user may fill out the form field any way they choose as long as it has the format of a valid US number. The following are examples of valid formats for US numbers (refer to the tests below for other variants):
<br><br>
555-555-5555<br>
(555)555-5555<br>
(555) 555-5555<br>
555 555 5555<br>
5555555555<br>
1 555 555 5555<br><br>
For this challenge you will be presented with a string such as 800-692-7753 or 8oo-six427676;laskdjf. <br>Your job is to validate or reject the US phone number based on any combination of the formats provided above. The area code is required. If the country code is provided, you must confirm that the country code is 1. Return true if the string is a valid US phone number; otherwise return false.

# About 
This is my solution to the challenge. I wrote the challenge in my Unit Test Environment, based on Mocha and Chai.<br>
If you're taking the course 'JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures' on FreeCodeCamp right now and you feel stuck - feel free to download my solution, try to recreate it and/or come up with a better solution.

# Mocha/Chai Test Unit - The files
The <strong>index.html</strong> implements all needed files. You don't need to make any changes in that file.<br><br>
The <strong>tests.js</strong> is the file where you can add, edit and remove the test cases. I added all the tests from FreeCodeCamp. So you don't have to make any changes here. But of course, feel free to play around with that file. If you're new to Chai, take a look at the Chai Documentation.<br><br>
The <strong>problems.js</stong> is the file with my solution to the challenge.
