# FreeCodeCamp - Caesars Cipher

# Challenge
One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

# About 
This is my solution to the challenge. I wrote the challenge in my Unit Test Environment, based on Mocha and Chai.<br>
If you're taking the course 'JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures' on FreeCodeCamp right now and you feel stuck - feel free to download my solution, try to recreate it and/or come up with a better solution.

# Mocha/Chai Test Unit - The files
The <strong>index.html</strong> implements all needed files. You don't need to make any changes in that file.<br><br>
The <strong>tests.js</strong> is the file where you can add, edit and remove the test cases. I added all the tests from FreeCodeCamp. So you don't have to make any changes here. But of course, feel free to play around with that file. If you're new to Chai, take a look at the Chai Documentation.<br><br>
The <strong>problems.js</stong> is the file with my solution to the challenge.
