# FreeCodeCamp - Palindrome Checker 

# Challenge
Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as racecar, RaceCar, and race CAR among others.

We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as 2A3*3a2, 2A3 3a2, and 2_A3*3#A2.

# About 
This is my solution to the challenge. I wrote the challenge in my Unit Test Environment, based on Mocha and Chai.<br>
If you're taking the course 'JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures' on FreeCodeCamp right now and you feel stuck - feel free to download my solution, try to recreate it and/or come up with a better solution.

# Mocha/Chai Test Unit - The files
The <strong>index.html</strong> implements all needed files. You don't need to make any changes in that file.<br><br>
The <strong>tests.js</strong> is the file where you can add, edit and remove the test cases. I added all the tests from FreeCodeCamp. So you don't have to make any changes here. But of course, feel free to play around with that file. If you're new to Chai, take a look at the Chai Documentation.<br><br>
The <strong>problems.js</stong> is the file with my solution to the challenge.
